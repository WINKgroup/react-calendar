## Roadmap

- [x] Add instructions in the README on how to build and run this package for contributors.
- [ ] Separate CSS in two separate modules:
   1. Unstyled which contains layout only CSS. Developer may only import this to style  in their own way.
   1. Styled which contains CSS that provides developers a ready-to-use styled calendar.
- [ ] Make sure that all elements have a (good) classname set to them so that developers can easily style them through CSS.
- [ ] Make a documentation on all those classnames.
- [ ] Optionally style differently weekend days.
- [ ] Add picker of months, years, (decades?) accessible through the header.
- [ ] We could provide style customization through SASS similiar to what [Bootstrap does](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/sass/).
